# Github-repos-table

**⚠️DISCLAIMER⚠️**


This project is just an inspiration i got from a youtuber named [Davon Crawford ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA) and his [website](https://www.devoncrawford.io/).I tried to recreate a table like Davon has on his website, which stores all github repos using  Github's own API.All this project is made using React &
Bootstrap.


Before you run the `$ npm start` command.Edit the `./src/App.js`
 ```javascript
state = {
    data: [],
    isLoading: true,
    error: null,
    //Replace USERNAME with yours
    username: 'USERNAME'
  };
```
